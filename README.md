# Intro-Node-supervillains

#### This was the introductory lesson to node, the software that allow us to take JavaScript out of the browser. 

#### For understanding it works we installed a module called supervillains from the npm library. We require it and then we save it in a constant, then we call it and apply the method .rando() for getting a randomized name for our villains. Once that done, then we just print it on the console.

#### For using the code you just have to download the files, open a terminal on the directory, once that done then run the command "node install" or "node i" for installing the dependencies, and finally just run the command "node index.js" like that you will obtain a name for your supervillains too.
